***

This repository contains data and code for the Homework 5 assignment for Colorado State University R Programming for Research Fall 2021 class.

The dataset in the data directory contains information on homicides in 50 US cities. It was published by the Washington Post and is publicly available from their GitHub repository here: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides. The article they published to accompany this data is here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/.

 The R markdown file in the writing directory contains the code to clean up the data and visualize the locations of homicides throughout Minneapolis, MN. Additional geographic data were obtained using the tigris package. 
 
 The final map can be found in the figures directory.
